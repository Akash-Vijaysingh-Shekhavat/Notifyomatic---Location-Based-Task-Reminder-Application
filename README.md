Notifyomatic - Location Based Task Reminder
Problem Statement:
In modern life, people need personal task management to be reminded of something at a specified time. Notifyomatic is a system that notifies users of tasks based on their location. Unlike traditional time-based reminders, this app triggers notifications when users are physically present in a designated area. This location-based task reminder tool is designed for Android smartphones and tablets, ensuring tasks are completed at the right place and time.

Features
Location-Based Reminders: Set reminders that trigger when you are near a specific location.
Time-Based Reminders: Option to set reminders for a specific time.
Traffic Information: Provides traffic updates for your destination.
Data Privacy: Ensures privacy by encrypting data and not constantly tracking user location.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.

Enable location services if not already enabled.
Display user's live location on the map.
Allow users to set geofence areas by long-pressing on the map.
Trigger notifications based on user's presence within the geofence.
Haversine Formula:
Used to compute the distance between the set location and user's location.
